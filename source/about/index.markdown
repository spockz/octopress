<!-- ## Personal
Something about me. My name is Alessandro Vermeulen and I've been around on the
net for several years. At the moment I'm following the Computer Science master
programme at Utrecht University, The Netherlands. My primary interests are
Haskell and typed systems, and compilers and language technologies. On occasion
I'm a teaching assistent for Bachelor courses at Utrecht University for the
courses Functional Programming and Internet Programming.

## Current employment
Currently I'm employed at BINK software B.V. as a Junior Programmer, developing
systems for internal usage and responsible for supporting the www presence of
the company.

## Talents
My greatest talents are working as a team to improve existing processes and
adding processes to ultimately enhance efficiency. This always-continuing search
for perfection has led to healthy discussions along the way, always resulting in
a better end product.

## Goals
Improving my academic skills and continuing investigating the possibilities of
languages such as Haskell and Agda. Other fields of interests are Web
Development and type systems. -->
