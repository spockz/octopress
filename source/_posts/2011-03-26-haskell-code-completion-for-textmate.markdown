Today I released my script for basic code completion support in TextMate.

The package can be found on <a title="The textmatetags package"
href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/textmatetags">hackage</a> and on <a
title="Haskell Code Completion for TextMate"
href="https://github.com/spockz/Haskell-Code-Completion-for-TextMate">github</a>.

Please read the README for installation instructions. Currently only identifiers
from interpreted source code is available. Future releases will aim at providing
better code completion support by using either Scion or HaskellSrcExts, or both.
