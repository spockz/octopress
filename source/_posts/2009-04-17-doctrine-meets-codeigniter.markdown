Anyone who has made websites in the past has encountered it. The endless bugging
typing of SQL queries, always doing the same over and over again. This struggle
is lightened by the use of frameworks or even complete CM-Systems. However, SQL
query writing is still often needed.

To counter this (and other annoying pestering little details mongering), Object
Relational Mappers were invented. <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org"
target="_blank">Doctrine</a> is a PHP implementation of the RoR ORM. And now
it's quite easy to merge CodeIgniter and Doctrine into one package.

Just follow the <a

target="_blank">readme</a> and continue your adventure.
