Anyone who has made websites in the past has encountered it. The endless bugging typing of SQL queries, always doing the same over and over again. This struggle is lightened by the use of frameworks or even complete CM-Systems. However, SQL query writing is still often needed.

To counter this (and other annoying pestering little details mongering), Object Relational Mappers were invented. <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org" target="_blank">Doctrine</a> is a PHP implementation of the RoR ORM. And now it's quite easy to merge CodeIgniter and Doctrine into one package.

Just follow the <a href="http://alessandrovermeulen.me/wp-content/2009/09/README.html" target="_blank">readme</a> and continue your adventure.
