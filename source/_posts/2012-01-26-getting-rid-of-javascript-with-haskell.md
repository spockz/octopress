For my Experimentation Project at Utrecht University I ported the "JCU"
application to Haskell. The JCU application is used to give Dutch High school
students the opportunity to taste Prolog.

The project uses the Utrecht Haskell Compiler and its JavaScript backend. The UHC
translates Haskell to Core and then translates this Core language to JavaScript.
For more information on this see the blog of the creator of the 
[UHC JavaScript backend](http://utrechthaskellcompiler.wordpress.com/2010/10/18/haskell-to-javascript-backend/).

Please read my [report](/downloads/report-on-getting-rid-of-js.pdf) on this
project. The project is hosted on GitHub in the following repositories:

* [JCU](https://github.com/spockz/JCU),
* [uhc-jscript](https://github.com/spockz/uhc-jscript),
* [NanoProlog](https://github.com/spockz/NanoProlog), and
* [UU-TC](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/uu-tc).
