After the <a
href="http://alessandrovermeulen.me/2010/10/23/lhs2tex-hl-released/">first
release</a> of my tool on hackage <a
href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lhs2TeX-hl-0.1.1.1">this release</a>
actually is a working package. The previous one didn't install out of the box.

The most important `changes ` are:

1. Added a filter for rewrite rules that aren't "lhs2TeX safe", e.g. `format () = ...`;
1. I hardcoded the default formatting rules for several of lhs2TeX defaults,
   including but not limited to `->`, `<-` and `=>`. This is not a desirable
   solution but it suits my purposes.

You can do literal (numeral, character and string) formatting easily with
lhs2TeX itself with the following directives:

``` latex
%subst char a    	= "\color{char}\text{\tt ''" a "''}"
%subst string a  	= "\color{string}\text{\tt \char34 " a "\char34}"
%subst numeral a =  "\color{numeral}{ " a " }"
```
