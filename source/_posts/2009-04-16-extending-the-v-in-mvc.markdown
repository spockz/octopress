Last year I wrote <a href="http://mirrored.spockz.nl/file/extendingthevinmvc.pdf">an article</a> about extending some of the ideas in the View section of MVC. I propose to use Partials and to use Lay-outs. Lay-out is perhaps a term that should be better defined. I wrote this article after an implementation in CodeIgniter.

This article introduces the concept of Partials (small views that contain parts and are reusable) and the concept of Lay-outs, used for displaying the same information in different formats.
<blockquote>When I first started working with MVC it was with my own framework. After seeing that it would require to much time to maintain and develop my own framework I started the search for a free, fast and widely supported php web framework. I found this framework and its name is `CodeIgniter'. You can find it at <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com" target="_blank">www.codeigniter.com</a>.</blockquote>
